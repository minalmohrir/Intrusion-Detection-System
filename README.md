# Intrusion-Detection-System
In this project, we use the KDD dataset to develop an intrusion detection system using machine learning algorithms and ensemble techniques. The dataset is first preprocessed to obtain clean and non-redundant data which is then tested against an ensemble model involving three classifiers namely Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.
